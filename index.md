#### Mississippi Record Lows And The Fed Pivot

10/18/2022 1:42PM

Drought has hit more than the Yangtze and Rhine rivers it seems as the Mississippi River has recorded all-time low water levels near Memphis. While droughts certainly affect crop yields, another crucial aspect is the effect on shipping. The reduction in water levels could result in a lowered capacity for barges which travel along the Mississippi, adding further restrictions to supply. Furthermore, reductions in the ability to ship goods like soybeans and corn could have additional negative effects on the ability for farmers to upkeep livestock. With inflation already at decade highs, greater restrictions in the supply of food could add to the persistently high CPI numbers. As the Fed looks to contract demand, it seems they are fighting a continually uphill battle and it is my opinion that easing will not occur unless credit spreads become too overbearing on businesses. Barring a severe credit event or high rates of delinquencies and defaults, it seems we will almost certainly be facing another 150 basis points this year and potentially smaller hikes to come next year.

In markets and in the media, it seems everyone is seeking the bottom. On a marginally worse than expected CPI release, there was a short-lived but intense rally in the major indices. Although the sentiment appears to be shifting towards finding any reason to be bullish, I believe reasons to be positive in the near term are few and far between. If low water levels put pressure on farmers and shipping via the Mississippi, we may be seeing high food prices accompany gas prices which will only push the Fed to restrict demand more severely. More troubling is the idea that farmers may begin to cut output in expectation of lower deliverable capacity. Perhaps the market has already baked in a looming recession, although it seems to me much of the bullish action is unfounded and speculative. The Bank of England's recent purchasing of gilts has lulled market participants into a sense of security and generated optimism regarding a potential pivot from the Fed. This is an outcome I find unlikely in the near future given the commitment made by the Fed and the necessity to maintain credibility in achieving inflation targets. We are in a very different place than we were during the pandemic, and it seems that markets are certainly not the primary concern of the Fed in making policy decisions. If the Fed remains tight to finish the year and early into the next I believe we could begin to see easing occur in the second half of 2023, but further supply related issues may throw a wrench in this timeline even assuming a higher targetted rate of inflation for the next few years. Either way, I am not one to call a bottom, but I find it hard to justify that it may come sooner rather than later.

#### Indications For Persistent Oil Demand

10/05/2022 6:10PM

Today OPEC+ announced production cuts of 2 million barrels per day (bpd). According to Reuters, since some OPEC nations were already below production targets, this amounts to an estimated real cut of 1 million bpd. The White House released a statement of "disappointment" regarding these cuts as the West attempts to weaken the leverage and economic benefits to Russia from higher oil prices. This output cut follows the minor cut made in September of 100,000 bpd, a minor reduction in the grand scheme of things, but equivalent to the production increase announced by OPEC not 2 months earlier following President Biden's visit to Saudi Arabia. The reason for Biden's visit? To lower energy prices and by extension consumer gas prices. In an attempt to keep prices low following today's announcement from OPEC+, the Department of Energy is scheduled to release another 10 million barrels from the Stratgeic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) onto the market next month. Throughout 2022 nearly 180 million barrels have been released from the SPR in order to lower costs at the pump. As of December 31, 2021 there were about 593,682,000 barrels in reserve, by September 30, 2022 this amounted to only 416,389,000. The historic release of oil from the SPR has undeniably lowered gas costs for consumers, but at what cost to the government? Releases were made under the assumption that the SPR could be refilled at a lower price in the following years, when geopolitical conditions are likely to be less tense. OPEC, in fact, based their production cuts on the premise of a looming recession and consequential reduction in demand for oil. However, I believe there are several factors that may lead to persistent demand for oil which may cause refilling US reserves to be more costly than anticipated.

On the surface level, the sheer amount of oil released from the SPR is not trivial relative to daily production amounts, which averaged 77 million bpd in 2021. This may lead to higher anticipated demand from non-production related activity in the following years as the SPR is refilled. Although there are many signs pointing towards an near-term global economic decline, the proactive cuts from OPEC and the sanctions on Russian energy significantly reduce the available supply of oil as inputs, let alone to refill US reserves. Further cuts from OPEC may arise as the dollar and other global currencies gain strength from higher interest rates. On the demand side, India's rapidly expanding economy may mean we are on the precipice of the next commodity super cycle. Life expectancy and GDP have been more rapidly increasing in India since the turn of the 21st century, while poverty rates have declined. On top of this, India passed the UK in early September to become the 5th largest global economy. Higher rates of expansion could lead to a comparable increase in demand for commodities which was recently seen with the extreme growth in China. Further increases in the rate of growth in India may induce upward pricing pressure on global commodity markets for a significant amount of time. Coupled with the reduction in supply due to an anticipated economic downturn and a gaping hole in the SPR, it seems higher energy prices may be here to stay, although perhaps not a current price levels. I eagerly await a plan from the White House to restore reserves and can only be hopeful that it does not cost the taxpayer more than it was worth in the end.

#### JOLTS Data And Rebounding Markets

10/04/2022 1:09PM

The past two days of trading have epitomised the volatile market conditions of the past couple years. As of writing, the S&P 500 is up 2.52% today following gains yesterday. Some would say that lower than expected Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) numbers have given the Fed reason to become more dovish, as labor demand is appearing to taper. Others may look toward the Bank of England's recent purchase of gilts as indication that the Federal Reserve may be in a similar position with regards to market instability caused by high benchmark yields. Earlier in the year, similar bullish gains off dovish sentiment were made from mid-June to mid-August before being snuffed out by hawkish Fed guidance. Although reduction in labor demand may signal that some wage inflation pressures are being reduced, I believe it is important to evaluate the previous track record of the Fed and their clear priority to stimulate disinflation. When CPI and PCE numbers release on the 13th and 28th respectively, this may serve as a better indicator of what the Fed will do at the November and December FOMC meetings. As of now, I don't expect the JOLTS data to provide enough information to reverse the Fed's hawkish course of action. For the last two years, speculation has seemingly become rife and valuations detatched from their fundamentals. The explosion of special entities like SPACs and the increase in leveraged derivatives trading amongst retail traders has painted a picture of Wall Street akin to Las Vegas. Have the past two years conditioned investors to be uncharacteristically bullish in the face of news, or could we truly be nearing the bottom of the market?

#### Fed Credibility And Tightening Conditions

9/27/2022 3:39PM

The credibility of a country's central bank is essential to the conductance of monetary policy. Faith that the actions of the central bank will result in the intended consequences makes the job of managing interest rates and inflation much easier. This is partially supported by the idea that inflation expectations can often affect the resulting inflationary conditions. Expectations of higher inflation may lead to workers asking for wage increases, resulting in price increases to meet the new demand for wages. On the other side, businesses expecting increases in the price of inputs may also increase the price of their products to protect their margins. The reputability of a central bank when it comes to managing inflation can influence the expectations for inflation for market participants and become a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, faith that a central bank will achieve target inflation levels can reduce the possibility of capital outflows resulting from higher than target inflation expectations and thus leading to further currency devaluations. The market can often be used as a guage for opinions on central bank activites. Higher long-term yields can indicate that the central bank is not in control of inflation, while low yields can reduce the cost to long-term borrowers and imply that monetary conditions are too tight. I believe the Federal Reserve is currently facing a predicament to maintain credibility and that significant doubts are being imposed upon them.

It is no longer news that the benchmark yield curve has inverted. Why does this matter and what exactly is a yield curve inversion? The benchmark yield curve is essentially a graph of the yields for default risk-free government bonds against different maturities. The yield curve is usually upward sloping, indicating that a longer time to maturity while have a higher yield. This is the case because longer time horizons have more uncertainty regarding economic conditions, and investors are thus compensated for the higher risk with a greater return. In the situation of a yield curve inversion, longer maturity bonds have lower yields than shorter maturity bonds. While this can be indicative of several things, such as imminent rate decreases, it is often a reliable leading indicator of recession. In the case described earlier where the market may have a higher demand for long-term debt and push yields lower, this can be a result of market forces anticipating a severe economic contraction due to tighter monetary conditions. Market participants, by lowering the yields for long-term debt, are effectively lowering the cost of capital for businesses to incentivize investment and prevent contractions.

In 2022, we have seen the Fed repeatedly raise its target rate by amounts exceeding 50 basis points with more to come. I believe that these rate increases are an attempt to wrestle inflation under control in order to maintain the Fed's credibility in managing inflation. The Fed is already seemingly behind on the rate increases and facing scrutiny from the transitory claims of current inflation, which is now at the highest level in four decades. As inflation worsened, due to geopolitical turmoil among other factors, the pressure on the Fed only continued to mount. Talks of a "soft landing" have seemingly gone out the window as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently reaffirmed his hawkish stance since the speech at Jackson Hole. The questions that remain now are how far the Fed will go to tame inflation and how their actions will affect near term growth prospects. Although there is near universal consensus that growth with be restricted in the near term, it is my opinion that there will be no "soft landing" and the coming economic contraction will be not be trivial as the Fed will likely overshoot with the rate increases. Fed policy is already determined by information recieved on a lag, and the Fed demonstrated a clear lack of foresight when inflation fears first began, even going as far as massaging their data to meet target ranges in late 2021. I think that the aggresive rate hikes from the Fed are a result of what most would consider a late response to address inflation. Now, the Fed is in a position where further inflation would lower their credibility significantly and reduce their ability to affect future expectations. For these reasons, I believe the Fed will do whatever they deem necessary to combat inflation, including plunging the US into recession. I do not think that Powell wants a hard recession by any means, but regardless of the necessity for the Fed to prove it can control inflation, the lagged response of the Fed during this whole debacle is what scares me more. I am confident the Fed's number one priority is fighting inflation right now, and reducing economic impacts have secondary considerations. Based on the fact that monetary policy is usually decided by data, which leads to an unavoidable lag in response, and the higher priority of price stability I think it is inevitable for the Fed to overshoot the rate increases.

#### Why Is Inflation Such a Big Deal?

9/22/2022 9:12AM

Rising inflation over the past year has led to a lot of media coverage about it. YOY inflation has been the highest since the 1970's and the Fed is racing to quell it and prevent a hyperinflationary scenario. Why is it so important that we keep inflation under control, and what does it mean to keep inflation under control? First let's establish the problems with persistently high inflation. In a scenario where inflation expectations were perfectly accuracte (meaning wage growth and price growth grew predictably in tandem), decreases in real income would not be the issue. The costs of this persistently high inflation would be the cost to businesses when changing advertised prices frequently (menu costs) and the cost to individuals for having to frequently withdraw money from banks (shoe leather costs) since people tend to hold less cash in inflationary environments. Both of these negatives caused by high inflation are not as costly now as we further digitize our consumption. If high inflation can be costly, why have inflation at all? The Fed targets a low inflation rate (generally 2-3 percent) to prevent unintended deflation caused by monetary policy and to stimulate consumption. If the future value of one's cash will be less in real terms, it makes more sense to buy things now rather than later. This also serves as the justification for why deflation is viewed so negatively. In deflationary scenarios, the real value of one's money will increase over time. While this may not lead to a direct fall in consumption of normal goods and necessities, the purchase of durable goods (which often require loans) may be deferred in order to buy at a more favorable price. This leads to a deflationary spiral where producers lower prices to meet lowered demand, and the expectation of further price decreases strengthens. If the costs of higher inflation are becoming less relevant today, why is inflation seen as a huge negative right now? It is important to clarify that the inflation we are currently seeing is generally unanticipated, and its consequences are more far-reaching. Unanticipated increases in inflation can lead to unwarranted increases in output by producers, wealth transfers from lenders to borrowers, and increases in borrowing costs due to uncertain conditions. Futhermore, many would say we are experiencing a period of *stagflation*, wherein a decline in economic output is paired with rising inflation. Intuitively, stagflation is largely negative because real incomes tend to fall with both the increase in prices and decrease in production, causing people to have less money to spend on more increasingly more expensive goods.

If this period of unexpected inflation is so bad, how does it get corrected? Inflation is driven in part by expectations for inflation, although it also is largely affected by supply and demand mechanics. An old saying related to the cause of inflation is that "more money chasing fewer goods" is what drives inflation. Although this is not generally accepted in modern economics, it can be boiled down to the concepts of supply and demand. Simply put, decreases in supply with the same level of demand, or increases in demand with the same level of supply will tend to put upward pressure on prices. During the pandemic shutdown, monetary stimulus was utilized to prop up demand and keep our level of consumption high even as we struggled to maintain the same level of output. This is a potential reason for the massive increases in asset prices that we have seen from 2020 and 2021. The invasion of Ukraine, draconian shutdowns in China, and increase in demand from the reopening have been large factors in the inflation we experience today. Now, the Fed is reversing course and raising interest rates through quantitative tightening to quell demand. Raising rates will increase the cost of borrowing and therefore, reduce consumption. Unfortunately, it is my opinion that the Fed is fighting an uphill battle, as there are many factors driving inflation which are related to global supply shortages. Furthermore, the current administration is not making the job of the Federal Reserve any easier with their legistlation, even if they name it the Inflation Reduction Act. Specifically related to the IRA, corporate tax minimums and taxation on stock buybacks (which is traditionally beneficial for holders of equity) will only serve to increase the pressure on corporate margins and may lead to further price increases to maintain profitability levels. More concerning is the potential increase in consumer demand that comes with the significant amount of loan forgiveness. Without getting into a discussion about the fairness or reasoning behind the loan forgiveness, it is important to recognize the increase in disposable income which will be granted to many consumers. This increase in disposable income may have a similar effect on demand as the stimulus which was deployed during the pandemic was intended to have (increase demand). Will loan forgiveness make it even harder for the Fed to fight inflation? Only time will tell, but in my opinion quantitative tightening was already difficult enough and the challenges only seem to be piling up.

#### September 20-21 FOMC Meeting and Conference Thoughts

9/21/2022 3:00PM

Today marked another 75bp rate hike after the FOMC meeting. In the following press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell discussed how rising rates have weakened the housing market and negatively affected fixed investment of businesses. Similar to the speech at Jackson Hole, Powell placed a heavy emphasis on the Fed taking a strong stance against inflation and to curb a potentially higher outlook on long term inflation. The FOMC members all reduced their GDP growth targets to below the long run median, and yet I can't help but feel as if their targets have not lowered enough. Increasing inflation, as I see it, has been spurned on by a large increase in demand (partially due to a reopening, and partially due to the stimulus over the past couple of years) and by major disruptions in supply due to global stress on supply chains. Athough there is an undeniable demand aspect to the inflation, I can't help but think that the supply issue is more pertinent to the rises in prices. Athough much of this is due to global disruptions, it is my opinion that large rate raises may further constirct supply (at least in the near term) as businesses struggle to maintain their levels of investment and struggle to acquire relevant inputs to their industry due to higher borrowing costs. Although it is certain that growth must slow down to combat inflation, will the Fed overshoot and plunge the economy into a deep recession? Worse yet, is it possible that 2023 sees more aggresive rate hikes which put the US at risk of experiencing a deflationary period? Only time will tell, but based on the lagged response of the Fed to acknowledge the non-transitory nature of current inflation, the necessity for the Fed to maintain credibility in their conducting of monetary policy, and the strongly hawkish position being broadcasted to the public it is not unforseeable that the Fed may behave too aggressively.
