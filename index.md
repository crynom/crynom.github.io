#### Why Is Inflation Such a Big Deal?

9/22/2022 9:12AM

Rising inflation over the past year has led to a lot of media coverage about it. YOY inflation has been the highest since the 1970's and the Fed is racing to quell it and prevent a hyperinflationary scenario. Why is it so important that we keep inflation under control, and what does it mean to keep inflation under control? First let's establish the problems with persistently high inflation. In a scenario where inflation expectations were perfectly accuracte (meaning wage growth and price growth grew predictably in tandem), decreases in real income would not be the issue. The costs of this persistently high inflation would be the cost to businesses when changing advertised prices frequently (menu costs) and the cost to individuals for having to frequently withdraw money from banks (shoe leather costs) since people tend to hold less cash in inflationary environments. Both of these negatives caused by high inflation are not as costly now as we further digitize our consumption. If high inflation can be costly, why have inflation at all? The Fed targets a low inflation rate (generally 2-3 percent) to prevent unintended deflation caused by monetary policy and to stimulate consumption. If the future value of one's cash will be less in real terms, it makes more sense to buy things now rather than later. This also serves as the justification for why deflation is viewed so negatively. In deflationary scenarios, the real value of one's money will increase over time. While this may not lead to a direct fall in consumption of normal goods and necessities, the purchase of durable goods (which often require loans) may be deferred in order to buy at a more favorable price. This leads to a deflationary spiral where producers lower prices to meet lowered demand, and the expectation of further price decreases strengthens. If the costs of higher inflation are becoming less relevant today, why is inflation seen as a huge negative right now? It is important to clarify that the inflation we are currently seeing is generally unanticipated, and its consequences are more far-reaching. Unanticipated increases in inflation can lead to unwarranted increases in output by producers, wealth transfers from lenders to borrowers, and increases in borrowing costs due to uncertain conditions. Futhermore, many would say we are experiencing a period of *stagflation*, wherein a decline in economic output is paired with rising inflation. Intuitively, stagflation is largely negative because real incomes tend to fall with both the increase in prices and decrease in production, causing people to have less money to spend on more increasingly more expensive goods.

If this period of unexpected inflation is so bad, how does it get corrected? Inflation is driven in part by expectations for inflation, although it also is largely affected by supply and demand mechanics. An old saying related to the cause of inflation is that "more money chasing fewer goods" is what drives inflation. Although this is not generally accepted in modern economics, it can be boiled down to the concepts of supply and demand. Simply put, decreases in supply with the same level of demand, or increases in demand with the same level of supply will tend to put upward pressure on prices. During the pandemic shutdown, monetary stimulus was utilized to prop up demand and keep our level of consumption high even as we struggled to maintain the same level of output. This is a potential reason for the massive increases in asset prices that we have seen from 2020 and 2021. The invasion of Ukraine, draconian shutdowns in China, and increase in demand from the reopening have been large factors in the inflation we experience today. Now, the Fed is reversing course and raising interest rates through quantitative tightening to quell demand. Raising rates will increase the cost of borrowing and therefore, reduce consumption. Unfortunately, it is my opinion that the Fed is fighting an uphill battle, as there are many factors driving inflation which are related to global supply shortages. Furthermore, the current administration is not making the job of the Federal Reserve any easier with their legistlation, even if they name it the Inflation Reduction Act. Specifically related to the IRA, corporate tax minimums and taxation on stock buybacks (which is traditionally beneficial for holders of equity) will only serve to increase the pressure on corporate margins and may lead to further price increases to maintain profitability levels. More concerning is the potential increase in consumer demand that comes with the significant amount of loan forgiveness. Without getting into a discussion about the fairness or reasoning behind the loan forgiveness, it is important to recognize the increase in disposable income which will be granted to many consumers. This increase in disposable income may have a similar effect on demand as the stimulus which was deployed during the pandemic was intended to have (increase demand). Will loan forgiveness make it even harder for the Fed to fight inflation? Only time will tell, but in my opinion quantitative tightening was already difficult enough and the challeneges only seem to be piling up.

#### September 20-21 FOMC Meeting and Conference Thoughts

9/21/2022 3:00PM

Today marked another 75bp rate hike after the FOMC meeting. In the following press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell discussed how rising rates have weakened the housing market and negatively affected fixed investment of businesses. Similar to the speech at Jackson Hole, Powell placed a heavy emphasis on the Fed taking a strong stance against inflation and to curb a potentially higher outlook on long term inflation. The FOMC members all reduced their GDP growth targets to below the long run median, and yet I can't help but feel as if their targets have not lowered enough. Increasing inflation, as I see it, has been spurned on by a large increase in demand (partially due to a reopening, and partially due to the stimulus over the past couple of years) and by major disruptions in supply due to global stress on supply chains. Athough there is an undeniable demand aspect to the inflation, I can't help but think that the supply issue is more pertinent to the rises in prices. Athough much of this is due to global disruptions, it is my opinion that large rate raises may further constirct supply (at least in the near term) as businesses struggle to maintain their levels of investment and struggle to acquire relevant inputs to their industry due to higher borrowing costs. Although it is certain that growth must slow down to combat inflation, will the Fed overshoot and plunge the economy into a deep recession? Worse yet, is it possible that 2023 sees more aggresive rate hikes which put the US at risk of experiencing a deflationary period? Only time will tell, but based on the lagged response of the Fed to acknowledge the non-transitory nature of current inflation, the necessity for the Fed to maintain credibility in their conducting of monetary policy, and the strongly hawkish position being broadcasted to the public it is not unforseeable that the Fed may behave too aggressively.
